This project, Image Recognition System, involves developing an image classification model to identify objects in images.
It includes a Python backend (app.py) for processing images, a frontend interface (index.html) for user interaction, and utility scripts (utils.py) for model operations.
The system likely uses machine learning or deep learning frameworks to process input images, classify them into predefined categories, and display results to the user.
A requirements.txt file lists dependencies for easy setup.
Its goal is to provide an efficient, user-friendly solution for automated object recognition in various applications such as security, research, and automation.
